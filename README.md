**A repository for coursework in JOUR2106**

## Introduction

Hi. I am Kitty, a year 3 student from the Department of Computer Science. As a CS student, I know little about journalism and data analysis. That is what I expect to learn from this course. I have learned some programming skills before but I am not good at writing codes. I sincerely wish that I am able to finish the assignments and projects using the skills I learned from this course. Hopefully, this can be counted as a part of my portfolio.
