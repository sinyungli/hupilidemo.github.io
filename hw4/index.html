         <h4>Here is a flawed data visualization found online.</h4>

         <h3>Good Points</h3>
         <ol>
            <li>Clear: Show the trend by positioning the coordinates of the languages and comparing them to the line (expected trend).</li>
            <li>Informative: The scale of the image is large, the image includes much programming languages to be compared.</li>
         </ol>
         <h3>Bad Points</h3>
         <ol>
            <li>Hard to read: All words are in black color plus the line is also in black, thus the words are packed closely.</li>
            <li>Boring: More description can be included, the image can also be made responsive to attract readers' interest.</li>
